        ABOUT HTC VIVE<br>

        <br>
        HEADSET<br>

        Once you put on the Vive headset, you’re immersed in a world full of surprises. Walk around freely and explore everything–the Chaperone guidance system keeps you safely within the bounds of your play area. Stunning graphics make it feel so real and surreal simultaneously. Headset features 110 degrees on view, 32 sensors for accurate detection, 2160X1200 resolution, and interchangeable foam inserts for a custom fit.  The headset works with most eyeglasses.
        <br>

        DUEL CONTROLLERS<br>

        HD haptic feedback and intuitive gestures mean playing games and interacting with the virtual world comes naturally. Vive’s two wireless controllers feature 24 sensors for unobstructed movement, meaning you can do more in VR than ever before.  Also features multi-function track pads and duel stage triggers on both controllers.
        <br>

        BASE STATION<br>

        You get 360˚ motion tracking with Vive thanks to breakthrough base station technology that helps the headset and controllers track their exact location in space. Freely explore and interact with the virtual world. Room-scale VR puts you at the center of everything.
